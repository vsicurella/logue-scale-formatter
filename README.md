# logue-scale-formatter
A basic web app for converting tuning data into a 'logue Sound Librarian scale format, for use with Korg's Monologue, Minilogue, Minilogue xd, and possibly even Prologue Sound Libriarian! Currently, this has only been tested with the Minilogue Librarian.

The reason I made this is because the Sound Librarian is not ideal for editing scales, and doesn't react to KBM files if you want to map the tuning to start on a certain note / tune to a certain frequency. This web app serves to simplify this. This feature will eventually be added to Sevish's Scale Workshop so that Sound Librarian scale files can be exported directly from there. https://github.com/SeanArchibald/scale-workshop
